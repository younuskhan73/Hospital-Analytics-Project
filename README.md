## Problem Statement:- 

  Healthcare organizations require data-driven insights to improve patient care,
  optimize hospital operations, and efficiently utilize resources.
  This project analysed hospital data to monitor patient flow, treatment patterns,
  and operational performance using interactive dashboards.


## Dataset:-

 - Hospital operational and patient-related data
 - Multiple tables including:
   - Patient details
   - Admissions and discharges
   - Doctors and departments
   - Treatments and billing
 - Data stored in Excel with multiple sheets and prepared using SQL


## Tools and Technologies:-

  - Power BI – Dashboard development and KPI visualization
  - SQL – Data modelling, joins, and aggregations
  - Excel – Data validation and pre-processing


## Analysis Performed:-

  - Patient admission and discharge trend analysis
  - Department-wise patient load and occupancy
  - Doctor-wise performance and workload analysis
  - Length of stay and treatment cost analysis
  - KPI tracking for hospital operations


## Dashboard Overview:-

 The Power BI dashboard provides:
  - Total admissions and discharges
  - Department-wise and doctor-wise performance
  - Patient length of stay trends
  - Treatment cost and revenue insights
  - Interactive filters for time period and departments


## Key Insights:-

  - Certain departments experience consistently higher patient load
  - Average length of stay varies significantly across departments
  - Patient inflow shows seasonal patterns
  - Some doctors handle higher workloads than others


## Business Recommendations:-

  - Optimize staffing for high-occupancy departments
  - Improve discharge planning to reduce length of stay
  - Balance doctor workload to improve efficiency
  - Use insights to support hospital resource planning
